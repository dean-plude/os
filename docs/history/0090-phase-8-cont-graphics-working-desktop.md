## Phase 8 (cont.) — Graphics & Working Desktop
- **HiDPI rendering** (`gdi/`): logical coordinates with an integer display
  scale (2× at 2560×1600); anti-aliased shapes, soft shadows, double
  buffering, and text in **Inter** / **Cascadia Mono** pre-rasterized at build
  time by `tools/mkfont.c` (fonts under `third_party/`, SIL OFL 1.1).
- **Window manager** (`wm/wm.c`): Windows 11-style frames; focus and z-order,
  drag by the title bar, double-click to maximize, minimize/maximize/close
  buttons, Alt+F4, keyboard focus, clipped client painting.
- **Built-in apps** (`apps/`): Terminal (a shell: `dir`, `cd`, `type`, `echo`,
  `mkdir`, `del`, `start`, `sysinfo`, `dmesg`, …), File Explorer, Notepad
  (edit + Ctrl+S), Settings (live system/display/storage info) and Calendar.
  Third-party apps pinned in the dock/Start menu open a "not available yet"
  note until real `.exe` files can run.
- **Drive C:** is a RAM disk (`fs/ramfs.c`) with starter folders and files;
  changes last until reboot.
- **Shell** (`wm/desktop.c`): the dock launches/focuses/minimizes apps and shows
  running indicators; Start menu tiles and "Recently Used" launch apps;
  desktop icons open on double-click; the Windows key toggles Start.
- Keyboard/mouse input is drained from the 100 Hz timer interrupt, so no
  input is lost while a frame is being drawn.
- Not yet real: apps are kernel-side callbacks (no user-mode GUI programs),
  there is no disk, and there are no image icons.  *(Since done: Windows
  programs in Phase 9, a disk in Phase 10, icons in the Desktop UX
  refresh.)*
