## Phase 8 — Interactive Desktop
- **Preemptive multitasking fixed**: the APIC timer ISR now calls `sched_tick()`
  (it was a stubbed `TODO`), so created threads actually run and are
  time-sliced. The shell runs in its own `desktop` kernel thread.
- **PS/2 input** (`hal/ps2.c`): polled i8042 keyboard + mouse; bytes are decoded
  into an event queue (`wm/input.c`). Keyboard uses scancode set 1; the mouse
  uses the 3-byte streaming packet.
- **Software mouse cursor** (`wm/wm.c`): an arrow drawn with *save-under* so it
  moves without recompositing the whole 2560×1600 scene.
- **Event loop** (`DesktopRun`): polls input, drives the cursor, and recomposites
  only on state change or once per minute. Left-click hit-tests the Start button
  (toggles the menu) and click-away / **Esc** closes it.
- **Live clock** (`hal/rtc.c`): the dock clock + date are read from the CMOS RTC.
- Verified under QEMU+OVMF: cursor tracks the mouse, Esc closes the Start menu,
  and the clock advances in real time.
